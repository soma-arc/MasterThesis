\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced an efficient algorithm 
called Iterated Inversion System (IIS) to visualize Kleinian
groups based on circle inversions and sphere inversions.

IIS has a constraint that we have to compute in parallel;
nevertheless it is useful. The application range of IIS is broad.
We can render many images related to Kleinian groups and tiling using
IIS.

On the other hand, there are also Kleinian groups, which we can not
visualize using IIS.
Our final goal is that for all Kleinian groups, we develop this kind of
efficient algorithm and get mathematical results from obtained images.
