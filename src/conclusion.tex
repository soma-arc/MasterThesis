\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced an efficient algorithm
called Iterated Inversion System (IIS) to visualize Kleinian
groups based on circle inversions and sphere inversions.
IIS is applied to each point on the plane in parallel.
Then we can visualize Kleinian groups efficiently.

The application range of IIS is broad.
We can render many images related to Kleinian groups and tiling using
IIS.
IIS and mathematics are developed close together.
Therefore IIS is taken notice by researchers who study Kleinian groups as
pure mathematics and computer graphics.

On the other hand, there is also a certain family of Kleinian groups,
which we can not visualize using IIS.
Our final goal is that for all Kleinian groups, we develop this kind of
efficient algorithm and get mathematical results from obtained images.
