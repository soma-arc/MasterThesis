\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we introduced an efficient algorithm
called Iterated Inversion System (IIS) to visualize Kleinian
groups based on circle inversions and sphere inversions.

IIS has a constraint that we have to compute in parallel;
Nevertheless it is useful. The application range of IIS is broad.
We can render many images related to Kleinian groups and tiling using
IIS.

There is a fractal called \textit{pseudo-kleinian} and
there are algorithms related to pseudo-kleinian.
The algorithms are fast like IIS, but they are not a Kleinian group which
mathematician means.
However, IIS and mathematics are developed close
together.
Therefore IIS is took notice by researcher who study Kleinian groups as
pure mathematics and computer graphics.

On the other hand, there are also Kleinian groups, which we can not
visualize using IIS.
Our final goal is that for all Kleinian groups, we develop this kind of
efficient algorithm and get mathematical results from obtained images.
