\section{Introduction}

Kleinian group theory is one of the fields of mathematics studying 
M\"obius transformation groups.
It is well suited to visualization and computer experiment;
There are aspects that mathematicians advance research from
visualization and experiment.
Visualized image of Kleinian groups often have beautiful fractal shape.
Thus, there are people who enjoy rendered images as an art.
In a sense, Kleinian group theory is interdisciplinary area between
mathematics and arts.

There are various methods to visualize Kleinian groups.
However, the methods basically take long time.
So, we introduce efficient algorithm to render Kleinian groups based on
circle or sphere inversions.
It is called \textit{Iterated Inversion System (IIS.)} 
IIS visualize not only two dimensional Kleinian groups but also three
dimensional Kleinian groups.
In this paper, we introduce basic usage of the IIS algorithm and its
applications.
