\section{Introduction}

Kleinian group theory is one of the fields of mathematics studying 
M\"obius transformation groups.
It is well suited to visualization and experiment;
Actually, Felix Klein, a mathematician who study Kleinian groups theory
in the nineteenth century and his students also leave beautiful visualized images
without a computer.
There are aspects that mathematicians advance research from
visualization and experiment.

After a computer appeared, various visualization and calculation are
performed by computer.
Visualized images of Kleinian groups often have beautiful fractal shape.
Thus, some people enjoy rendered images as art.
For example,
\textit{Fractalforums}\footnote{\url{https://fractalforums.org/}}
community gathers many fractal enthusiasts and discusses fractals.
The fractals generated by Kleinian group theory also come up for
discussion.
In a sense, Kleinian group theory is an interdisciplinary area between
mathematics and arts.

Mumford, Series, and Write wrote a book called
\textit{Indra's Pearls} \cite{MumfordSeriesWright200204}.
The book is written for non-mathematician and contains explanation
about Kleinian group theory, many beautiful visualized images, and
methods of visualization.
Thus, not only math enthusiast but also programmers enjoy the book.

However, the book deal with a small part of Kleinian group.
Because of the properties of the group, we can not
visualize all of the types of Kleinian groups in real time
in spite of the growth of the performance of a personal computer.

Our goals are to visualize all of the Kleinian groups in real time by
personal computer and help us understand the Kleinian group theory
intuitively with computer software.

As the first step to the goals, we invent an algorithm called
\textit{Iterated Inversion System (IIS)}.
IIS is an algorithm to render Kleinian group based on circle or sphere
inversions.
It visualizes not only two-dimensional Kleinian group but also
three-dimensional Kleinian group.
In this paper, we introduce the basic usage of the IIS algorithm and its
applications.
