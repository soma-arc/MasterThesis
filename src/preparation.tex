\section{Preparation}

In this section, we introduce some mathematical terms and prerequisites
to understand the IIS algorithm and basic usage of IIS.

\subsection{Transformation Group Theory}

In this paper, we use terms about Kleinian groups used in Indra's
Pearls \cite{MumfordSeriesWright200204}.
The word \textit{group} represents an algebraic group which is
central concept about group theory.
Algebraic group is a set which has multiplication, satysfies the
associative law, has a unit, and has an inverse element for each
element.

Also, a transformation group is an algebraic group consists of transformations 
on a topological set $X$.  Here a transformation is a homeomorphism
$f:X \to X$.

We will introduce the M\"obius transformation group and Kleinean group
as a subgroup of the M\"obius transformation group. 
In this paper, we mainly consider the cases $X=\tilde{\mathbb{C}}$,
which is the union of the complex set and the infinity, 
and $X=\tilde{ \mathbb{R} }^3$, which is the union of $\mathbb{R}^3$ and the infinity.
In our context we suppose proper topologies on $\tilde{\mathbb{C}}$ 
by the complex topology of $P^1(\mathbb{C})$ and on $\tilde{ \mathbb{R} }^3$
by one-point compactification from $\mathbb{R}^3$ respectively.

We will introduce M\"obius transofmation group on $\tilde{\mathbb{C}}$ and $\tilde{ \mathbb{R} }^3$.  
First, the two-dimensional M\"obius transformation group
\textrm{M\"ob}$(\tilde{\mathbb{C}})$ is the set of linear fractional transformations $f(z)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}$, 
where $a,b,c,d$ are complex numbers and they satisfy $ad-bc = 1$. Here we naturally extend a complex function $f(z)$ 
into a transformation on $\tilde{\mathbb{C}}$.  
A linear fractional transformation is a conformal orientation-preserving homeomorphic map.
See also section 2.3.
From another point of view, a M\"obius transformation is the composition of even number of circle inversions.  
About inversions, see section 2.2.
In the same manner, we consider the three-dimensional M\"obius
transformation group \textrm{M\"ob}$(\tilde{\mathbb{R}}^3)$
In the three-dimensional case, we define a M\"obius transformation as
the composition of even number of sphere inversions.

\subsection{Inversions in Circles or Spheres}

In the two dimensional case, it is well known that M\"obius transformations on $\tilde{\mathbb{C}}$
are composed of even number of circle-inversions and line-symmetries.
Here, if a circle is centered at $C\in\mathbb{C}$ and it has a radius $R\in\mathbb{R}$ ($R>0$).
Then the formula of the inversion along the circle is given by
$f(z) = \frac{R^2}{~\overline{z -C}~} + C$.
Since $f \circ f$ is the identity map, the inversion map is a homeomorphism on $\tilde{\mathbb{C}}$.
Remark that the inversion is an orientation-reversing conformal map on $\tilde{\mathbb{C}}$.

We often distinguish the inversion from a line symmetry map.
But in this context, by interpreting the line on the complex plane as a circle centered at the infinity, 
we may regard the line symmetry as a kind of the inversion. 
In the sequel, we will call inversion both of circle-inversions and line-symmetries.
In this category, any inversion is orientation-reversing, conformal,
and homeomorphic on $\tilde{\mathbb{C}}$.

Here we will make a short note on the Jacobian of inversion.
If the inversion is a line symmetry, the determinant of the Jacobian is $-1$.
Otherwise if the inversion is a circle-inversion, remarking that a circle inversion
preserve any angles, we obtain that Jacobian mapping is given by the composition of multiplication by a complex constant
and complex conjugate.
Thus the determinant of the Jacobian at a point $P\in\mathbb{C}$ is given by the following formula:
\[ \mathrm{Det}(\mathrm{Jacobian}) = R^4 / distance(P,~C)^4 \]%
Here the Jacobian is a composition of a scaling and a rotation and a complex conjugate, and we obtain the following.
\[ \mathrm{scaling~factor~at~} P  = R^2 / distance(P,~C)^2. \]

In the similar way as the definition of a circle-inversion,
a sphere-inversion can be defined as follows.
Fix a sphere $C$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.  Let its center be $C$ and its radius be $R$. 
A sphere-inversion $I_C$ is a homeomorphism on $\tilde{\mathbb{R}}^3$ 
determined by a map from a point $P$ to a point $Q = I_C(P)$ such that (i) $Q$ is on the half line $CP$ and 
that (ii) $\overline{CP}\cdot \overline{CQ} = R^2$.
As above, the definition of a circle-inversion can be extended to a plane-symmetry
in the same way as a line-symmetry in the two dimensional case.

\subsection{M\"obius Transformations and the Hyperbolic Geometry}

First we review the definition of a group action. 
Let $G$ be a group and $X$ be a set. A map $G \times X \to X : (g,x) \mapsto g\cdot x$
is called a $G$-action on $X$ if it satisfies the following conditions.
\par \qquad (1) $e \cdot x = x$ for all $x \in X$. (Here, $e$ denotes the unit of $G$.)
\par \qquad (2) $(gh) \cdot x = g \cdot (h\cdot x)$ for all $g, h \in G$ and for all $x \in X$.

In this study, we handle $PSL_2\mathbb{C}$-action on $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$.
Here $PSL_2\mathbb{C}$ is the projective space of $2 \times 2$ complex matrices $A$ with $\mathrm{det}(M)=1$.
M\"obius transformation is defined as a linear fractional transformation
$f(z)=\dfrac{az+b}{cz+d}$ for complex variable $z$ where constants
$a, b, c, d$ are complex numbers and satisfy $ad - bc = 1$.

If we consider a map $\varphi: \dfrac{az+b}{cz+d} \mapsto \begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c& d \end{pmatrix}$,
from the set of linear fractional transformations to $PSL_2\mathbb{C}$.
This map $\varphi$ is a group isomorphism and it gives an induced action of $PSL_2\mathbb{C}$ on $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$.
In the sequel, we regard the action of linear fractional transformations
and that of $PSL_2\mathbb{C}$ without distinction.
For more details about M\"obius transformation, refer
\cite{MumfordSeriesWright200204}\cite{marden_2016}.

M\"obius transformation is deeply related to the hyperbolic geometry.
When all of the coefficients in $f(z) = \dfrac{az + b}{cz + d}$
are real number, $f(z)$ preserve upper-half plane.
Moreover, $f(z)$ preserves the hyperbolic metric $\dfrac{dz^2}{(\mathrm{Im}z)}$
on the upper-half plane.
Such linear fractional transformations corresponds to an element of $PSL_2\mathbb{R}$.
Thus the $PSL_2\mathbb{R}$-action on the upper half plane is
the isometric transformation group of the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$.

When the coefficients $a, b, c, d$ are complex numbers, 
the action can be thought as an isometric transformation group on the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$.
We consider the upperhalf model of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$.
In fact, 
\[\mathbb{H}^3 = \{ (z,t) \in \mathbb{C}\times \mathbb{R}\mid t>0 \} \cup \{\infty\} \]
is the upper half model with the hyperbolic metric $\dfrac{dz^2+dt^2}{t^2}$ and 
$\hat{\mathbb{C}} = \{ (z,0) \mid z \in \mathbb{C}\} \cup \{ \infty\}$
is the set of infinity. The two dimensional M\"obius transformation group acts on $\hat{\mathbb{C}}$
naturally and it is well known that this action can be extend to 
an action on the upper half model as isometric transformations.
This extension is called \textit{\lq Poincar\'e extension\rq}.
As above, researching structures of the M\"obius transformation groups is heavily
related to studying three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry and hence hyperbolic manifolds.
For more details, refer 
\cite{Marden200705outerCircles}\cite{taniguchi_okumura199610invitation}.

In this paper, we also consider the three dimensional M\"obius
transformation on $\hat{\mathbb{R}^3} = \mathbb{R}^3\cup\{\infty\}$.
The definition of the three dimensional M\"obius transformation in the two ways as follows.
One is the simple extension of the two dimensional version.
A M\"obius transformation is defined as a composition of even number of sphere-inversions 
and plane-symmetry.
The other is the representation of the isometry group of the four dimensional hyperbolic space.
To represent three-dimensional M\"obius transformation using matrix,
we consider a quaternion $2 \times 2$ matrix group called
$Sp^k(1,1)$. About this topic, refer
\cite{sakugawa2010limit}\cite{sakugawa2007master}.

Three-dimensional M\"obius transformations are deeply related to
the four-dimantional hyperbolic space. In fact, the upper-half space model of
the four-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}$ is homeomorphic to the 
four-dimensional open ball and its boundary (the infinity point set of the hyperbolic
space) is $\hat{\mathbb{R}^3} = \mathbb{R}^3\cup\{\infty\}$.
Using Poincar\'e extension, a sphere-inversion in $\hat{\mathbb{R}^3}$
is extended to an (orientation-reversing) isometric transformation of $\mathbb{H}^4$.
Thus the composition of even numbers of sphere-inversions corresponds to an orientation-preserving
isometry, and it is known that any isometry of $\mathbb{H}^4$ is given in this way.
In this point of view, three-dimensional M\"obius transformations are
deeply related to the four-dimensional hyperbolic space and four-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.

\subsection{Classification of M\"obius Transformations}

Excluding the identical map, we will classify M\"obius transformations
$f(z) = \dfrac{az + b}{cz + d}$ into three types.
The types are \textit{elliptic}, \textit{parabolic}, and \textit{loxodromic}.
It is well-known that the standard form of $PSL_2\mathbb{C}$
is either one of $\begin{pmatrix}1 & \lambda \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$(, $\lambda$ is a non-zero constant,) or
$\begin{pmatrix}\lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda^{-1} \end{pmatrix}$(, $\lambda$ is a non-zero constant,) 
from a famous theorem in linear algebra.
If $X=\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$ is conjugate to the former one,
then $f(z)$ is called a parabolic transformation.
If $f(z)$ is parabolic, the number of fixed point is one, and
the matrix $X$ satisfy $\mathrm{tr}^2X = 4$.

When the standard form of $X$ is
$\begin{pmatrix}\lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda^{-1} \end{pmatrix}$,
we have the following two cases. 
One is the case $|\lambda|=1$ and the other is the case $|\lambda|\neq 1$ 
If $|\lambda|=1$ then $f(z)$ is called an elliptic transformation.
When $f(z)$ is elliptic,  the fixed point set of $f(z)$ consists of two distinct points,
and $f(z)$ gives a rotation around these fixed points.
And $f(z)$ is elliptic if and only if $\mathrm{tr}^2X > 4$.
Remark that if the order of a M\"obius transformation $f(z)$ is finite
then it is elliptic.

If the standard form is
$\begin{pmatrix}\lambda & 0 \\ 0 & \lambda^{-1} \end{pmatrix}$
with $|\lambda| \neq 1$, then $f(z)$ is called a loxodromic transformation.
In a special case, if $\lambda$ is real number other than $\pm 1$, the transformation is called
a \textit{hyperbolic} transformation too.
When $f(z)$ is loxodromic the number of the fixed point set of $f(z)$ is two.
One of the fixed points is called an attracting fixed point and the other is called a 
repelling fixed point. This is because the orbid space of $f(z)$ of a
general point $z_0$ has two limit point and one of two is the limit of
$f^n(z_0)$ for $n\to \infty$, and the other is the limit of $f^n(z_0)$
for $n\to -\infty$. 
Also, $f(z)$ is loxodromic if and only if $\mathrm{tr}^2X < 4$.

The set of three-dimensional M\"obius transformations also have a similar
classification into six types.
In three dimensional case, each types \lq parabolic\rq, \lq elliptic\rq, \lq loxodromic\rq has 
a modifier \textit{simple} and \textit{compound}.
Thus there are six variations of classification types, for example \lq\lq simple elliptic\rq\rq or
\lq\lq compound loxodromic\rq\rq.
For detailed information of classfication of three dimensional M\"obius transformation, see chapter 4.3.2.

\subsection{Kleinian Groups}

A Kleinian group is a group originated from the name of Felix Klein who is
a famous mathematician in nineteenth century.
A group $G$ is a Kleinian group if it satisfies the following two
conditions. 
First, $G$ is a subgroup of the M\"obius transformation group.
Second, the $G$-action on $\mathbb{H}^3$,
is properly discontinuous.
Here a $G$-action on $\mathbb{H}^3$
is properly discontinuous if and only if
for any compact set $K \subset \mathbb{H}^3$
there are only finite number of elements $g \in G$ such that
$\gamma (K) \cap K \neq \O$.

When the $G$-action is properly discontinuous, 
the $\epsilon$ neighborhoods of points in the orbit space are disjoint
for a positive $\epsilon$.
This follows that there exists a
fundamental domain with positive volume in $\mathbb{H}^3$.
Because a M\"obius transformation gives an isometric transformation of
$\mathbb{H}^3$, a Kleinian group gives a hyperbolic three manifold 
as a quotiont space of the group. 
Basic properties of a Kleinian group are described in chapter 2 of \cite{marden_2016}.

In this paper, we consider a M\"obius transformations in a broad sense, that is,
a map which is the composite of
any number of inversions.
In order to distinguish an original M\"obius transformation,
we call it \textit{an extended M\"obius transformation}.
The composite of odd number of inversions
is an orientaion-reversing map represented by $f(z)=\dfrac{a{\bar{z}}+b}{c{\bar{z}}+d}$, where
$a, b, c, d$ are complex number and $ad-bc = 1$.

An extended M\"obius transformation induces an isometric mapping 
(not necessarily to be orientation-preserving) on the three-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$ by
Poincar\'e expansion.
We call a properly discontinuous subgroup of the extended M\"obius transformation group
\textit{an extended Kleinian group}.

\subsection{Limit Set}

Let $G$ be a Kleinian group.
For a general point $z_0 \in \hat{\mathbb{C}}$,
a point $p  \in \hat{\mathbb{C}}$ is a limit point 
of the orbit space of $z_0$ if and only if 
there exists a sequence $\{ g_i \} \subset G$ such that 
$\displaystyle \lim_{i\to\infty} g_i(z_0) = p$.
We call the closure of all limit points of an orbit space $Gz_0$ \textit{the limit set} of $G$.
The limit set is denoted by $\Lambda(G)$.
Some of properties are very useful to visualize the limit set of a Kleinian group.
\begin{itemize}
\item The limit set does not depend on a general point $z_0$.  
That is, the closure of all limit points of any orbit space is $\Lambda(G)$.
\item The limit set is preserved by $G$-action.  That is,
the image of action $g\in G$ of a point $p\in \Lambda(G)$  
      also is included in the limit set $\Lambda(G)$.
\item For any element $g \in G$, the fixed point of $g$ is contained in the limit set.
\end{itemize}
Much more properties of the limit set is also described in chapter 2.4.1 of
\cite{marden_2016}.

Here we have some concepts to describe limit points of an orbit. 
One is an algebraic limit and the other is a geometric limit.
When we fix a set of generators of a Kleinian group $G$, we represent any elements in $G$ 
as a word of these generators and their inverses.
Let a loxodrmic element $g$ be a word $a_1a_2\cdots a_r$.
Suppose that a point sequence $\{ (a_1a_2\cdots a_r)^n\cdot z_0 \}$ converges to a point $p$ in the limit set.
This limit point $p$ is one of the fixed points of $g$.
Thus we consider a formula $p = (\overline{a_1a_2\cdots a_r})z_0$, where $\overline{a_1a_2\cdots a_r}$
is a circulating decimal of generators (and their inverses.)
However $\overline{a_1a_2\cdots a_r}$ is not an element in $G$, supposing an abstract infinite word,
we may consider a point on the limit set as a point in an orbit.
This way of thinking is called an algebraic limit of $G$.
On the other hand, the original definition of a limit point is obtained in a geometrical way of thinking.
Thus such limit point is also called a geometric limit.
